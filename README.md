# ModuleFederation-Lit
Just a little Lit project made during my Internship to use Webpack Module Federation ðŸ˜„

## What was done

In this repo, you'll find a veryvery little `Lit` project, with just one element, who is exposed by the `Webpack` plug-in `ModuleFederation`.

Take it and play with it ! Have fun ! ðŸ˜‰
